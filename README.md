## Assignment

## For this assignment, you'll refactor your Bookmarks API project, bookmarks-server, to use a bookmarks database. You built the Bookmarks API project in the assignment for the POST & DELETE requests checkpoint. The project supports GET, POST and DELETE for bookmarks stored in JavaScript arrays within the server. You'll need to refactor this project to use the database for the GET /bookmarks and GET /bookmarks/:bookmark_id endpoints instead of the JavaScript arrays.
